# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`, which contains relevant health indicators. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Handling imbalanced data using oversampling and undersampling
- Training multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, recall score, F1-score, and classification report

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Place `diabetes.csv` in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) step by step.

## Results
The models' performances are evaluated based on accuracy and other classification metrics. The best-performing model can be used for predicting diabetes based on the provided health indicators.
